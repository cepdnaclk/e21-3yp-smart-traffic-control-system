## Introduction

Urban congestion is one of the defining challenges of modern cities. Traditional traffic control systems rely on **static, fixed-timer logic** that is blind to real-world conditions. A traffic light stays red even when the road is empty, while kilometers of cars sit idling on the cross-street. This inefficiency leads to billions of dollars in wasted fuel, increased carbon emissions, and severe delays.

**HYDRA (HYbrid Dynamic Realtime Automation)** is an intelligent traffic management system that replaces static timers with dynamic, sensor-driven logic. It integrates **Heavy Vehicle Detection** (to extend green times for trucks) and **Rain Sensors** (to increase safety margins), creating a responsive, organic traffic flow.

## Solution Architecture

High level diagram 

HYDRA follows a **Centralized-Edge Topology**:
* **The Physical Layer:** A dual-intersection kinetic model using **Gravity-Fed Servo Barriers** to physically drive toy cars automatically when the light turns Green.
* **The Edge Layer:** **ESP32 Microcontrollers** at each intersection handle real-time sensing (IR, Ultrasonic, Piezo, Rain).
* **The Cloud Layer:** A **Raspberry Pi (MQTT Broker)** acts as the central brain, running the "Green Wave" algorithm.

## Hardware and Software Designs

### Hardware Components
* **Raspberry Pi 4:** Central Server & MQTT Broker.
* **ESP32 Dev Kit v1:** Edge computing nodes.
* **Sensors:** HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic), IR Break-Beam, Piezo Vibration, Rain Sensor.
* **Actuators:** SG90 Servo Motors (Barrier Mechanism), Traffic LEDs.

### Software Components
* **Firmware:** C++ (Arduino) for ESP32.
* **Backend:** Python script for "Green Wave" logic ($T = D/V$) and heavy vehicle compensation.
* **Protocol:** MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) over WiFi.

## Testing

We validated the system through three core scenarios:
1.  **Green Wave:** A platoon released from Intersection A arrived at B exactly as the light turned Green.
2.  **Heavy Vehicle Override:** Dropping a weighted model car over the Piezo sensor successfully triggered an extended Green time.
3.  **Safety Mode:** Spraying water on the rain sensor successfully increased the Yellow Light duration.
